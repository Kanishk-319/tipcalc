# Tip Calculator

As you would've already guessed by the name, Tipcalc is a web application that helps users calculate the appropriate tip amount for a given bill at a restaurant or any other service where tipping is customary. 


## Installation

This is a basic web application made using simple HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript. So the Installation is also pretty generic :
* Firstly, you have to fork this repository and clone it in your PC.
* If you don't have the `golive` extension installed in your system, then just download and enable it from the extension section present in the VS Code.
* After downloading the `golive` extension, you have to open the cloned respository in your VS Code, and just click on the `golive` button at the bottom left corner of the VS Code window.

    
## Usage
After starting the application, you would see the page containing a tip calculator at the center. 
Now you have to fill the three required fields to get the required tip and see the full functionality of this application.
* **Bill Amount** : This fields asks for the total amount of bill that one has to pay (obviously excluding the tip amount).
* **Number of Guests** : This asks for the total number of guests including you who were given this bill.
* **Tip**: Finally, based on the quality of the service provided by the staff, tip will vary from outstanding to terrible ratings. The better the experience, more the tip will be provided by you.
